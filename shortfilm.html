    <h1>Short Film Making</h1></center><br>
    <p><h2><center>Here the students will have to make one short film based on social issues or issues<br>
         which have an impact on society or giving a social message. <br>
         Here the other institute can compete with each other.<br>
          The student can generally form a group to make a team for film making. <br>
          All the film will be shown in a special slot or screening during the fest <br>
          and the jury member will decide the best film and rewarded the team. <br>
          This can be also done regardless of stream and specialisation of students.<br>
